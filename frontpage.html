<h3>
  A meme is defined as an element of a culture or system of behavior that is passed from one individual to another by non-genetic means, especially imitation. However, the more familiar definition of the word &#34;meme&#34; is &#34;a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by Internet users.&#34; The word meme is derived from the Ancient Greek word &#34;mimeme&#34; meaning &#34;imitated thing&#34; or &#34;to imitate.&#34; The word &#34;meme&#34; itself was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins as an idea of either the spread of ideas or cultural phenomena.

The meme was popularized in the game VRChat, where any player can create a model of any character they want and become them. AS VRChat got more popular, so did this meme. A video got very popular when a bunch of the Uganda Knuckles said the infamous line at the same time.</td><td><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/meme/images/e/e5/Stoopid_Meme.png/revision/latest?cb=20180814025755"/></td></tr>
